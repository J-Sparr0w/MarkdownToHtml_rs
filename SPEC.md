# Headings
## 1. Using '#' 
    * '#': Lines starting with this will be formatted as a heading.
    * No. of consecutive '#' will be formatted to corresponding <h> tag of html. For e.g., ## : corresponds to <h2>
    * If the line does not start with a '#' character, it will not be formatted as a heading.
    * If there is no whitespace (ws will be used hereafter) after '#' character, then it will not be formatted as a heading

## 2. Using /heading
    * /heading transforms the rest of the line to a heading
    * It can have characters before it which will not be transformed, instead everything after the /heading will be formatted as a heading
    * It can have a number along with it, for e.g., /heading2 for <h2>
